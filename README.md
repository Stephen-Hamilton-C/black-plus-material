# Black+ Material

A fork of vangware's Dark+ Material

## Reason behind this

I work a lot in Angular, and the Angular Material theme has really grown on me. I decided to try and make VS Code look more like the Angular apps I was creating. I stumbled upon vangware's Dark+ Material theme and it was almost perfect. I prefer black themes over dark themes, and Dark+ Material had a dark grey background and very dim highlighting for classes. So, I decided to fork the theme and make my own modifications, having absolutely no knowledge of how to fork repos, let alone create a VS Code theme.
